Deploy an E-Commerce Website to Microsoft Azure

Step 1: Create a Virtual Network (VNet) Navigate to the Azure portal and create a Virtual Network (VNet):
o	Set up a production environment with appropriate subnets (e.g., a subnet for application servers and another for database servers).
o	Assign an address range (e.g., 10.0.0.0/16).
Add a Bastion Host to enable secure RDP/SSH access to virtual machines within the VNet- We need this if we need to access our private subnet resources.
o	Deploy the Azure Bastion service within the VNet.
o	Ensure NSG (Network Security Group) rules allow only secure access.

Step 2: Create Virtual Machine Scale Sets (VMSS)
Deploy a Virtual Machine Scale Set to ensure high availability and scalability:
o	Select an appropriate VM size based on workload requirements.
o	Use a custom image or Azure Marketplace image for your e-commerce application.
o	Configure auto-scaling rules to handle varying levels of traffic (e.g., scale out when CPU usage exceeds 75%).

Step 3: Configure Application Gateway with Load Balancer
Deploy an Application Gateway to handle smart traffic distribution:
o	Configure a frontend IP to serve as the public endpoint.
o	Set up a backend pool with the VMSS instances.
o	Create HTTP settings to ensure proper communication between the gateway and backend servers.
In my lab, I used application gateway public IP address to access the ecommerce application, 
But you can configure a custom domain name or DNS to allow users to access the website via a user-friendly URL
